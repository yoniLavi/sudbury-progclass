Introduction to programming using python in Hebrew

These are the tutorials for an introduction to programming workshop I organized for high-school kids during the spring of 2014 at the Jerusalem Sudbury school.

Some of the material and the formatting was inspired by the codeclub.org.uk international tutorials, which are available outside the UK under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. As far as I can do so, I encourage any reuse of these materials for any purpose.
